# **Milesight WS302 Sound Level Sensor Blueprint Guide**

The **Milesight WS302 Sound Level Sensor** is designed to monitor and analyze
sound levels in various environments, providing metrics such as instantaneous
sound levels (**LA**), equivalent continuous sound levels (**LAeq**), and
maximum sound levels (**LAmax**). It also monitors battery levels and RSSI for
reliable operation. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the
sensor, register it with **The Things Network (TTN)**, and integrate it with
**Blynk IoT** for data visualization and control.

### **2.2 Create a New Application**
1. **Log in to TTN Console**.
2. **Create an Application**:
   - Navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**.
   - Enter:
     - **Application ID**: A unique name (e.g., `sound-monitor`).
     - **Description**: (e.g., `Monitoring environmental noise levels`).
     - **Handler**: Select the handler for your region.
   - Click **Create Application**.
   - *[Insert Screenshot of TTN Application Creation Page]*

> **Note:** 
> To ensure smooth operation, itâ€™s recommended that all devices within a TTN application are of the same sensor type (e.g., WS302). If youâ€™d like to use different types of sensors, consider creating a separate application for each sensor type. This helps maintain better compatibility and performance.
---

### **2.3 Pair the Sensor with TTN Application**
1. **Open Milesight ToolBox App**:
   - Pair the sensor via NFC.
   - Navigate to **LoRaWAN Settings**.
   - *[Insert Screenshot of LoRaWAN Settings in ToolBox App]*
2. **Configure LoRaWAN Parameters**:
   - **DevEUI**: Use default value (found on the sensor label).
   - **AppEUI**: Use default value from manufacturer or generate a new one.
   - **AppKey**: Use default from the manufacturer or generate a new one.
   - **Frequency Plan**: Match the frequency plan configured in TTN.
   - **RX2 Data Rate**: Set to DR3 (SF9, 125 kHz).
   - **Spreading Factor**: Set to SF10-DR2.
   - **Default Application Port**: Set to 85.
   - Write changes by NFC to the sensor using button **Write**.

## **Step 3: Integrating TTN with Blynk**

### **3.1 Configuring Blynk Integration via MQTT**
1. Push button **Use Blueprint** at the top of page with blueprint for WS302.

2. **Set Up MQTT in Blynk**:
   - Navigate to **Developer Zone** > **Integrations** > **The Things Stack** -> **Add** and choose template named **Milesight WS302**
   - Enter data from **Step 2**:
     - **Hostname**: MQTT server address with port `1883` or `8883` (e.g., `eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8883`).
     - **Username**: 
     - **Password**: API key that you are copied.
     - Click **Connect**.
     
When status will be **Connected** tap to **Edit** and turn on switch **Enable automated device onboarding**:
  - Specify the LoRaWAN version, Frequency plan, and Regional Parameter Version. Also, enable the "Support class B" and/or "Support class C" checkboxes if required.
  - Specify the addresses of The Things Stack components, which can be found by navigating to Home -> Admin panel -> Network information at the bottom of the page. If you are using The Things Stack Sandbox, all components share the same regional domain like **https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network**.
  - Save changes.

## **Step 4: Onboard sensor to Blynk**

1. Go to the **Developer Zone** -> **My Templates** -> choose **Milesight WS302** -> at the right panel you have button **Activate device**
2. In the windows that opened type data that you provide into app for Sensor in step 2.3:

  - Application key 
  - Join EUI 
  - DEV EUI
 
3. Tap **Next** and wait when device come online. 

You can go to the TTN and check that your device create automatically into application and you can add other sensor the same way by creating new dev by using blynk. When device went to online your redirect to the dashboard and you can testing your setup.

## **Step 5: Monitoring and Analyzing Data**
